# NexysA7-VerilogProjects

This repository contains Verilog code for RTL designs targeting the Nexys A7 100T FPGA. The code here includes various modules and components intended for FPGA-based projects and experiments, primarily written and tested for the Vivado environment.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the Verilog source files organized by module or functionality.
- **tb/**: Holds testbenches for each module. Testbenches allow simulation and verification of each component.
- **constraints/**: Contains constraints files (`.xdc`) for the Nexys A7 100T board to define pin assignments and timing.
- **docs/**: Additional documentation, diagrams, or explanations of each module.

## Getting Started

To use this code with the Nexys A7 100T FPGA, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RanLeon99/NexysA7-VerilogProjects.git
   cd NexysA7-VerilogProjects
